Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change your current directory to the project directory using the cd command:
cd <project-directory>

Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
`npm install`

If the installation fails, you can try running:
`npm install --force`

Once the installation is successful, start the application by running:
`npm start`

This command will start a local development server, and you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000/.

Build the Application:
If you need to create a production build of the application, you can run:
`npm run build`
This command will create a build folder containing optimized production-ready files for deployment.
By following these steps, you can set up and run the application locally from the GitHub repository. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before running these commands.

Replace <project-directory> with the name of the project directory you cloned.
